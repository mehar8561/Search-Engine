Table Contents Introduction SQL Offline Application Caching APIs Related APIs References Acknowledgments Introduction Users typical online Web applications are only able use applications have connection Internet. go offline, longer check e-mail, browse calendar appointments, prepare presentations online tools. Meanwhile, native applications provide features: e-mail clients cache folders locally, calendars store events locally, presentation packages store data files locally. addition, offline, users are dependent HTTP cache obtain application since contact server get latest copy. HTML specification solutions SQL-based database API storing data locally, offline application HTTP cache ensuring applications are available even user not connected network. SQL client-side SQL database HTML structured data storage. be used store e-mails locally e-mail application cart online shopping site. API interact database asynchronous user interface lock up. database interaction occur multiple browser windows same time API supports transactions. create database object use openDatabase() method Window object. arguments: database name, database version, display name, estimated size, bytes, data be stored database. instance: var db openDatabase("notes", Example Notes App!", Now database use transaction() method. transaction method arguments: transaction callback, error callback, success callback. transaction callback passed SQL transaction object use executeSQL() method. method arguments: SQL statement, arguments, SQL statement callback, SQL statement error callback. SQL statement callback passed transaction object SQL statement result object access rows, last inserted ID, et cetera. complete infrastructure notes application add following code: function renderNote(row) note somewhere}function reportError(source, message) report error}function renderNotes() db.transaction(function(tx) tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT Notes(title TEXT, body TEXT)', tx.executeSql(‘SELECT Notes’, function(tx, rs.rows.length; renderNote(rs.rows[i]); insertNote(title, text) db.transaction(function(tx) tx.executeSql('INSERT Notes VALUES(?, title, text function(tx, function(tx, error) reportError('sql', error.message); Offline Application Caching APIs mechanism ensuring Web applications are available even user not connected network manifest attribute html element. attribute URI manifest, files are be cached. manifest text/cache-manifest MIME type. typical file CACHE MANIFESTindex.htmlhelp.htmlstyle/default.cssimages/logo.pngimages/backgound.pngNETWORK:server.cgi file several files cache, then never be cached, so attempt access file bypass cache. manifest then be linked declaring application, HTML><html manifest="cache-manifest">... file be white-listed NETWORK: section) so be contacted get updates server, as src="server.cgi"> event-source element new feature HTML servers continuously stream updates Web page.) application cache mechanism also supports way opportunistically cache server) group files matching common prefix, ability have fallback page rendering pages offline. also way scripts add remove entries cache dynamically, way applications atomically update cache new files, optionally presenting custom UI update. Related APIs addition APIs HTML also onLine attribute Navigator object so determine are currently online: var online navigator.onLine; Changes attribute are indicated online offline events are dispatched Window object. simple synchronous storage access HTML localStorage attribute Window object: localStorage["status"] References progress) HTML I.
