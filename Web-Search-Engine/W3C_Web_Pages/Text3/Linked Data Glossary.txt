JSON JavaScript Object Notation syntax storing exchanging text based information. JSON proven be highly useful popular object serialization messaging format Web. also: application/json Media Type JavaScript Object Notation JSON-LD JavaScript Object Notation Linking Data language-independent data format representing Linked Data, based JSON. JSON-LD capable serializing RDF graph dataset most, not JSON-LD documents be directly transformed RDF. JSON-LD Syntax easy humans read write as as, easy machines parse generate. JSON-LD appropriate Linked Data interchange language JavaScript environments, Web service NoSQL databases. also: JSON-LD Syntax Linked Data pattern hyperlinking machine-readable data sets other using Semantic Web techniques, especially use RDF URIs. distributed SPARQL queries data sets browsing discovery approach finding information compared search strategy). Linked Data intended access humans machines. Linked Data uses RDF family standards data interchange RDF/XML, RDFa, Turtle) query Linked Data published public Web, generally called Linked Open Data. also Data Principles]. Linked Data API REST API data publishers provide URLs lists things clients retrieve machine-readable data URLs. Linked Data client Web client supports HTTP content negotiation retrieval Linked Data URLs SPARQL endpoints. Linked Data client standard REST API, example Linked Data REST API. Examples Linked Data clients include: Tim Berners-Lee's early Tabulator browser, gFacet, Callimachus Shell Linked Data Platform specification REST API read write Linked Data purposes enterprise application integration. Linked Data Platform use REST API accessing, updating, creating deleting resources servers. also Linked Data Principles Provide common API data Web more convenient many separately differently designed APIs published individual data suppliers. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor Web initiator Linked Data project, proposed following principles Linked Data based: Use URIs name things; Use HTTP URIs so things be referred looked up people user agents; someone up URI, provide useful information, using open Web standards such as RDF, SPARQL; Include links other related things using URIs publishing Web. Linked Open Data Linked Data published public Web licensed several open licenses permitting reuse.

Linking Open Data Project community activity started W3C's Semantic Web Education Outreach Interest Group. project's stated goal data freely available everyone". Linkset collection RDF links datasets. Machine Readable Data Data formats be readily parsed computer programs access proprietary libraries. example, CSV, TSV RDF formats are machine readable, PDF Microsoft Excel are not. Creating publishing data following Linked Data principles search engines humans find, access re-use data. Once information found, computer programs re-use data need custom scripts manipulate content. Publishing machine readable data using Linked Data principles human machine readable version. example, Wikipedia Web page about color Red. DBpedia, database containing structured content contained Wikipedia, Linked Data client look up changing appending appropriate file extension. curl Message basic unit HTTP communication. structured sequence octets matching syntax defined as HTTP Message transmitted connection. Metadata Information used administer, describe, preserve, present, use link other information held resources, especially knowledge resources, be physical virtual. Metadata be further subcategorized several types general, access structural metadata). Linked Data human machine readable metadata along making self describing.
