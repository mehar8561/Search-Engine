Extensible Markup Language simple text-based format representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, much more. was derived older standard format called SGML order be more suitable Web use.

HTML, there are also numeric character references, such as &#38; refer Unicode character, number decimal, Unicode tables number usually hexadecimal. XML also hexadecimal references: example. XML number advantages over many other formats. particular scenario, be able come up better format, then have include costs converting processing format, training, XML-specific editing searching tool are now very widely available. advantages XML include: Redundancy XML markup very verbose. example, end tag be supplied, such as example. computer catch common errors such as incorrect nesting. Self-describing readability XML text-based format) presence element attribute names XML means people looking XML document often get head start understanding format also people find mistakes!)

Today, XML most widely-used format kind anywhere world. Examples XML very widely used today. basis great many standards such as Universal Business Language Universal Plug Play used home electronics; word processing formats such as ODF OOXML; graphics formats such as SVG; used communication XMLRPC Web Services, supported directly computer programming languages databases, giant servers way down mobile telephones. double-click icon computer desktop icon have been drawn SVG), chances are XML message sent component desktop take car be repaired, engine's computer XML mechanic's diagnostic systems. age XML: everywhere.
