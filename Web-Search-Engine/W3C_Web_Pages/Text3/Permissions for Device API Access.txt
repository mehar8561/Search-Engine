Permissions permission described document identified using string specified document. permissions needed be identified as URI widget configuration file URI be built strings appending string base DAP base URI entirely tentative stage. Geolocation API geolocation identifier access either Geolocation::getCurrentPosition Geolocation::watchPosition methods defined Geolocation API Web browser environment, permission usually granted explicit user’s consent, retained later access same session. Contact API identifier access Contacts::find method defined Contacts API Web browser environment, permission usually granted implicitly asking user select data contacts be shared, call said method. Capture API mediacapture identifier access Capture::captureImage, Capture::captureVideo Capture::captureAudio methods defined Media Capture API Web browser environment, permission usually granted implicitly asking user activate button start stop recording operations, call said methods. File API identifier access FileReader::readAsArrayBuffer, FileReader::readAsBinaryString, FileReader::readAsText FileReader::readAsDataURL methods defined File API Web browser environment, permission usually granted implicitly once File object been created, after user selected file file picker, retained later access same browsing context. identifier access FileWriter::write, FileWriter::truncate, FileWriterSync::write FileWriterSync::truncate methods defined File Writer API Web browser environment, permission usually granted implicitly once FileSaver object been created, after user selected path data be saved dialog). System Information API deviceinfo identifier access data Power, CPU, Thermal, AVCodecs, Storage, OutputDevices, InputDevices properties available SystemInfo::get SystemInfo::watch methods defined System Information API networkinfo identifier access data Network property available SystemInfo::get SystemInfo::watch methods defined System Information API sensorinfo identifier access data AmbientLight, AmbientNoise, AmbientTemperature, AmbientAtmosphericPressure Proximity properties available SystemInfo::get SystemInfo::watch methods defined System Information API Web browser environment, permissions are usually granted explicit user’s consent, are retained later access same session. A. Mapping BONDI features Android permissions section maps permissions defined document BONDI feature strings corresponding Android permissions. BONDI feature URIs are formed appending BONDI string base URI: BONDI Android values are only given as examples. Note also section contain errors. BONDI Android meanings not correspond as shown even names are similar not be equivalent. A.1 Geolocation W3C API permissions BONDI Feature Android Permissions Identifier Scope Identifier Scope geolocation Detection user’s position android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION access coarse Cell-ID, WiFi) location android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION access fine GPS) location A.2 Contacts W3C API permissions BONDI Feature Android Permissions Identifier Scope Identifier Scope Read contacts stored terminal android.permission.READ_CONTACTS read user's contacts data.
