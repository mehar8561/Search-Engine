Application developers are strongly encouraged support are listed as RECOMMENDED application environment resource constraints make such support impractical. Compliance recommendation maximize application interoperability libraries be available enable support applications extensive development. Canonicalization canonicalization algorithm be used CanonicalizationMethod as Canonicalization Algorithms be used as Transform. Base64 Identifiers: Input: octet-stream, node-set Output: octet-stream normative specification base64 decoding base64 Transform element content. input decoded algorithms. transform useful application needs sign raw data associated encoded content element. transform either octet-stream node-set as input. octet-string given as input, then octet-stream processed directly. XPath node-set sufficiently functional alternative) given as input, then converted octet stream performing operations logically equivalent applying XPath transform expression self::text(), then sorting nodeset document order, then concatenating string-value nodes long string. Thus, XML element identified shortname XPointer Reference URI, content solely base64 encoded character data, then transform automatically strips away start end tags identified element descendant elements as as descendant comments processing instructions. output transform octet stream. XPath Filtering Identifier: Input: octet-stream, node-set Output: node-set normative specification XPath expression evaluation XPath expression be evaluated as character content transform parameter child element named XPath. input required transform XPath node-set octet-stream. Note actual input XPath node-set resulting null URI shortname XPointer dereference, then comment nodes have been omitted. actual input octet stream, then application convert octet stream XPath node-set suitable use Canonical XML Comments. subsequent application REQUIRED Canonical XML algorithm strip away comments.) other words, input node-set be equivalent be created following process: Initialize XPath evaluation context setting initial node equal input XML document's root node, set context position size Evaluate XPath expression evaluation expression document's nodes comments) node-set representing octet stream. transform output always XPath node-set. XPath expression appearing XPath parameter evaluated once node input node-set. result converted boolean. boolean true, then node included output node-set. boolean false, then node omitted output node-set. Note: Even input node-set had comments removed, comment nodes still exist underlying parse tree separate text nodes. example, markup comment text nodes. Therefore, expression self::text()[string()="Hello, world!"] fail. problem arise application, be solved either canonicalizing document before XPath transform physically remove comments matching node based parent element's string value using expression self::text()[string(parent::e)="Hello, world!"]). primary purpose transform ensure only specifically defined changes input XML document are permitted after signature affixed. done omitting precisely nodes are allowed change once signature affixed, including other input nodes output. responsibility XPath expression author include nodes change affect interpretation transform output application context. Note XML-Signature XPath Filter Recommendation be used purpose. recommendation XPath transform permits easy specification subtree selection omission be efficiently implemented. important scenario be document requiring enveloped signatures. signature omit own digest calculations, also necessary exclude second signature element digest calculations first signature so adding second signature not break first signature. XPath transform following evaluation context node input node-set: context node equal node input node-set. context position, initialized context size, initialized library functions equal function set defined augmented function named here be treated as part library not namespace prefixed). set variable bindings. means initializing defined. Thus, set variable bindings used evaluating XPath expression empty, use variable reference XPath expression results error. set namespace declarations scope XPath expression. result context node setting, XPath expressions appearing transform be quite similar used used size position are always reflect fact transform automatically visiting node XSLT, recursively calls command apply-templates visit nodes input tree). function here() defined as Function: node-set here() here function returns node-set containing attribute processing instruction node parent element text node directly bears XPath expression. expression results error containing XPath expression not appear same XML document XPath expression being evaluated. example, consider creating enveloped signature Signature element descendant element being signed). signed content not be changed after signing, elements Signature element are changing digest value be put inside DigestValue SignatureValue be subsequently calculated). way prevent changes invalidating digest value DigestValue add XPath Transform Signature elements descendants. example, Example xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"> URI=""> Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116"> xmlns:dsig="&dsig;"> not(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Signature) Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1"/> null Reference URI example, XPath transform input node-set nodes entire parse tree starting root node comment nodes). node node-set, node included output node-set node ancestors tag Signature namespace given replacement text entity more elegant solution uses here function omit only Signature containing XPath Transform, thus allowing enveloped signatures sign other signatures. example above, use XPath element: Example xmlns:dsig="&dsig;">count(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Signature XPath equality operator converts node sets string values before comparison, instead use XPath union operator node document, predicate expression true only node-set containing node Signature element ancestors not include enveloped Signature element containing XPath expression union not produce larger set enveloped Signature element node-set given ancestor-or-self::Signature). Enveloped Signature Transform Identifier: Input: node-set Output: node-set enveloped signature transform T whole Signature element containing T digest calculation Reference element containing T. entire string characters used XML processor match Signature XML production element removed. output transform equivalent output result replacing T XPath transform containing following XPath parameter element: Example xmlns:dsig="&dsig;">count(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Signature input output requirements transform are identical XPath transform, only be applied node-set parent XML document. Note not necessary use XPath expression evaluator create transform. However, transform produce output exactly same manner as XPath transform parameterized XPath expression above. XSLT Transform Identifier: Input: octet-stream Output: octet-stream normative specification XSL Transformations Specification namespace-qualified stylesheet element, be sole child Transform element, specified style sheet be used. instantiates processing local XSLT declarations resource determined XSLT processing model; ordered application multiple stylesheet require multiple special provision made identification remote stylesheet given URI because be communicated xsl:include xsl:import stylesheet child Transform. transform octet stream as input. output transform octet stream. processing rules XSL style sheet transform element are stated XSLT specification RECOMMEND XSLT transform authors use output method xml XML HTML. XSLT implementations do not produce consistent serializations output, further RECOMMEND inserting transform after XSLT transform canonicalize output. steps help ensure interoperability resulting signatures applications support XSLT transform. Note output actually HTML, then result steps logically equivalent XML Canonicalization Syntax Constraint Considerations Digital signatures only work verification calculations are performed exactly same bits as signing calculations. surface representation signed data change signing verification, then way standardize changeable aspect be used before signing verification. example, even simple ASCII text there are least widely used line ending sequences. possible signed text be modified line ending convention time signing signature verification, then line endings need be canonicalized standard form before signing verification signatures break. XML subject surface representation changes processing discards surface information. reason, XML digital signatures have provision indicating canonicalization methods signature so verifier use same canonicalization as signer. specification distinguish canonicalization Signature element other signed XML data objects. possible isolated XML document be treated as were binary data so changes occur. case, digest document not change need not be canonicalized signed verified as such. However, XML read processed using standard XML parsing processing techniques frequently changed such surface representation information lost modified. particular, occur many cases Signature enclosed SignedInfo elements since possibly encompassing XML document, be processed as XML. Similarly, considerations apply Manifest, Object, SignatureProperties elements elements have been digested, DigestValue be checked, are being processed as XML. kinds changes XML need be canonicalized be divided categories. There are related basic as described below. There are related similar processing as described below. Third, there possibility coded character set conversion, such as UTF-8 UTF-16, compliant processors are required support, described paragraph immediately below. fourth, there are changes related namespace declaration XML namespace attribute context as described below. canonicalization algorithm yield output specific fixed coded character set. canonicalization algorithms identified document use UTF-8 byte order mark do not provide character normalization. RECOMMEND signature applications create XML content elements descendants/content) Normalization Form C check XML being consumed form as well; not, signatures consequently fail validate). Additionally, none algorithms provide data type normalization. Applications normalize data types varying formats false) not be able validate other's signatures. XML Syntax Constraints, Canonicalization XML interface conformant application reading XML given certain information XML not other information. particular, line endings are normalized single character #xA dropping #xD characters are immediately followed #xA replacing #xA other cases, missing attributes declared have default values are provided application as present default value, character references are replaced corresponding character, entity references are replaced corresponding declared entity, attribute values are normalized replacing character entity references as above, replacing occurrences #x9, #xA, #xD #x20 sequence #xD#xA replaced single space, attribute not declared be CDATA, stripping leading trailing spaces replacing interior runs spaces single space. Note items depend presence schema, DTD similar declarations. Signature element type laxly schema valid consequently external XML even XML same document as signature be well-formed namespace permitted signature schema); noted items not be present. Thus, signature such content only be verifiable other signature applications following syntax constraints are observed generating signed material including SignedInfo element: attributes having default values be explicitly present, entity references other character entities not representable encoding chosen) be expanded, attribute value white space be normalized DOM/SAX Processing Canonicalization addition canonicalization syntax constraints discussed above, many XML applications use Document Object Model Simple API XML DOM maps XML tree structure nodes typically be used entire document subsequent processing being done tree. SAX converts XML series events such as start tag, content, etc. either case, many surface characteristics such as ordering attributes insignificant white space start/end tags lost. addition, namespace declarations are mapped over nodes apply, losing namespace prefixes source text most cases, losing namespace declarations appeared original instance. XML Signature be produced verified system using DOM SAX processing, canonical method needed serialize relevant part DOM tree sequence SAX events. XML canonicalization specifications, such as are based only information preserved DOM SAX. XML Signature be verifiable implementation using DOM SAX, not only XML syntax constraints given section XML Syntax Constraints, Canonicalization be followed appropriate XML canonicalization be specified so verifier re-serialize DOM/SAX mediated input same octet stream was signed. Namespace Context Portable Signatures consequently Canonical XML data model element namespace nodes correspond declarations element ancestors: element E namespace nodes represent namespace declarations as as namespace declarations made ancestors have not been overridden E's declarations, default namespace non-empty, declaration prefix xml." serializing Signature element signed XML data child other elements using data models, Signature element children have namespaces inherited ancestral context. addition, Canonical XML Canonical XML Comments algorithms define special treatment attributes XML namespace, cause be part canonicalized XML even were outside document subset. Simple inheritable attributes attributes have value most simple redeclaration such as xml:lang xml:space) are inherited nearest ancestor are declared apex node canonicalized XML are already declared node. frustrate intent signer create signature context valid example, given signature child B grandchild Example xmlns:n1="http://foo.example"> xmlns:n2="http://bar.example"> xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"> URI="#signme"/> ID="signme" xmlns="http://baz.example" either element B signed element C moved envelope transport: Example xmlns:SOAP="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"> xmlns:n2="http://bar.example"> xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"> ID="signme" xmlns="http://baz.example" canonical form signature context contain new namespace declarations SOAP:Envelope context, invalidating signature. Also, canonical form lack namespace declarations have originally had element context, also invalidating signature. avoid problems, application Rely enveloping application properly divorce body signature payload) context envelope) before signature validated. Use canonicalization method instead ancestor context. purposefully such context. Security Considerations XML Signature specification very flexible digital signature mechanism.

Note, core validation behavior not confirm signed data was obtained applying step indicated check digest resulting content matches specified signature.) example, applications be satisfied verifying XML signature over cached copy already transformed data. Other applications require content be freshly dereferenced transformed. Only Signed Secure First, obviously, signatures over transformed document do not secure information discarded only signed secure. Note use Canonical XML internal entities XML namespaces are expanded content being signed. entities are replaced definitions canonical form explicitly namespace element otherwise inherit. Applications do not canonicalize XML content SignedInfo element) NOT use internal entities represent namespace explicitly content being signed since not rely canonicalization do Also, users concerned integrity element type definitions associated XML instance being signed wish sign definitions as schema, DTD, natural language description associated namespace/identifier). Second, envelope containing signed information not secured signature. instance, encrypted envelope signature, signature not protect authenticity integrity unsigned envelope headers ciphertext form, only plaintext actually signed. Only be Signed Additionally, signature information introduced transform: only represented user visual, auditory other media) be signed. signing intended convey judgment consent user automated mechanism person), then normally necessary secure as exactly as practical information was presented user.

Check Security Model specification uses public key signatures keyed hash authentication codes. have substantially different security models. Furthermore, permits user specified algorithms have other models. public key signatures, number parties hold public key verify signatures only parties private key create signatures. number holders private key be minimized preferably be Confidence verifiers public key are using binding entity capabilities represented corresponding private key important issue, usually addressed certificate online authority systems. Keyed hash authentication codes, based secret keys, are typically much more efficient terms computational effort required have characteristic verifiers need have possession same key as signer. Thus verifier forge signatures. specification permits user provided signature algorithms keying information designators. Such user provided algorithms have different security models. example, methods involving biometrics usually depend physical characteristic authorized user not be changed way public secret keys be have other security model differences.
