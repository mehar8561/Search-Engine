Scope Linked Data set best practices publishing interlinking structured data access humans machines use RDF Description Framework) family standards data interchange SPARQL query. RDF Linked Data are not synonyms. Linked Data however not exist consistent underlying data model call RDF Understanding basics RDF helpful leveraging Linked Data. Background recent years, governments worldwide have mandated publication open government content public Web purpose facilitating open societies support governmental accountability transparency initiatives. order realize goals open government initiatives, W3C Government Linked Data Working Group offers following guidance aid access re-use open government data. Linked Data simple mechanism combining data multiple sources Web. Linked Data addresses many objectives open government transparency initiatives use international Web standards publication, dissemination reuse structured data. Summary Best Practices following best practices are discussed document listed here convenience. STEP #1 PREPARE STAKEHOLDERS: Prepare stakeholders explaining process creating maintaining Linked Open Data. STEP #2 SELECT DATASET: Select dataset benefit others reuse. STEP #3 MODEL DATA: Modeling Linked Data representing data objects are related application-independent way. STEP #4 SPECIFY APPROPRIATE LICENSE: Specify appropriate open data license. Data reuse more likely occur there clear statement about origin, ownership terms related use published data. STEP #5 GOOD URIs LINKED DATA: core Linked Data well-considered URI naming strategy implementation plan, based HTTP URIs. Consideration naming objects, multilingual support, data change over time persistence strategy are building blocks useful Linked Data. STEP #6 USE STANDARD VOCABULARIES: Describe objects previously defined vocabularies possible. Extend standard vocabularies necessary, create vocabularies required) follow best practices possible. STEP #7 CONVERT DATA: Convert data Linked Data representation. typically done script other automated processes. STEP #8 PROVIDE MACHINE ACCESS DATA: Provide various ways search engines other automated processes access data using standard Web mechanisms. STEP #9 ANNOUNCE NEW DATA SETS: Remember announce new data sets authoritative domain. Importantly, remember as Linked Open Data publisher, implicit social contract effect. STEP #10 RECOGNIZE SOCIAL CONTRACT: Recognize responsibility maintaining data once published. Ensure dataset(s) remain available organization be maintained over time. Prepare Stakeholders Preparation crucial success information management project. Sharing government stakeholders benefits data sharing terms agency mission charter ensure success. concepts data modeling be familiar information management professionals. specifics Linked Open Data be new people are used traditional information manaagement approaches, are well-documented W3C Recommendations, Notes many peer reviewed publications Linked Data entered mainstream used governments around world, major search engines, international corporations agile startups. help prepare stakeholders, included life cycle models, however evident share common sometimes overlapping) activities. example, identify need specify, model publish data standard open Web formats. essence, capture same tasks are needed process, provide different boundaries tasks. workflow not better are simply different ways visualize familiar information management process. Hyland et al. provide model, create, publish, announce government linked data. highlight role World Wide Web Consortium currently driving specifications best practices publication governmental data. Hyland et al. lifecycle following activities: Identify, Model, Name, Describe, Convert, Publish, Maintain. According Hausenblas et al. existing data management approaches assume control over schema, data data generation, not case Web because open, de-centralized environment. Based experience Linked Data publishing consumption over past years, identify involved parties fundamental phases, provide multitude so called Linked Data life cycles consist following steps: data awareness, modeling, publishing, discovery, integration, use cases. Villazón-Terrazas et al. propose first step formalize experience gained development government Linked Data, preliminary set methodological guidelines generating, publishing exploiting Linked Government Data. life cycle following activities: Specify, Model, Generate, Publish, Exploit. Select Dataset publishing dataset, select data uniquely collected created organization. Ideally, information combined other open data greater value. Government agencies are unique position collect curate valuable datasets. there effort cost associated modeling, publishing maintaining data set as public service, selection high value data sets be guided re-use potential popularity, other factors. Data about geographic features, human health, legislation, population demographics, environmental data are just popular open government data sets have been published as Linked Open Data. example, publishing regulated facilities then be linked latitude longitude facilities be plotted map. data then be extended using post codes allowing people search post code facilities are near map view. Facilities data published as extensible Linked Data Web developers rapidly build Web are useful machines humans. Model Data not scope document treat Linked Open Data modeling process comprehensively. Rather, provide guidance conducting Linked Data modeling describe few aspects differentiate Linked Data modeling other approaches. Participants modeling process include participants represent broad range concerns including: government program office, data steward originating data source, data standards policies. example, source data relational database, modeling meetings include database administrator data steward. organization data standards group, include stakeholder modeling effort. Linked Data subject matter expert facilitate modeling process be capable explaining Linked Data Principles data life cycle Prepare Stakeholders). modeling phase involve onsite virtual meetings stakeholders specify details about data, including objects mean are related other. Linked Data subject matter expert typically records information order complete remaining steps modeling process. Understanding Differences Linked Data modeling data going model example, modeling involve converting tabular representation data graph-based representation. Often extracts relational databases are modeled converted Linked Data more rapidly integrate datasets different authorities other open source datasets. data modeling process, stakeholders are encouraged describe objects are related. subject matter expert recording various objects are related, using standard vocabularies possible. Best practices using standard vocabularies are detailed later document. Linked Data, data schema represented data mechanism self-describing data contrasts relational approach external documents data dictionaries) diagrams entity relationship diagrams, logical schemas) describe data. Linked Data modeling differentiated use international open Web standards. Linked Data predicated use international standards data interchange RDFa, JSON-LD, Turtle RDF/XML) query SPARQL. Linked Data modeling many advances modern information management, including increased levels data abstraction. hope highlighting differences helpful better efforts publish open government data. Specify Appropriate License important specify data published Web explicitely connect license data Governmental authorities publishing open data are encouraged review relevant guidance open licenses copyright. Publishing Linked Open Data associating license travels data easier. People are more likely reuse data there clear, acceptable license associated valuable resource open data publishers be found Creative Commons Web site. Creative Commons supports, stewards legal technical infrastructure digital content publishing. Role URIs" Linked Data URI Design Principles Web use URI as single global identification system. global scope URIs large-scale effects". Therefore, order benefit value LD, government governmental agencies need identify resources using URIs. section set general principles aimed helping government stakeholders define manage URIs resources. Use HTTP URIs benefit increase value World Wide Web, governments agencies provide HTTP URIs as identifiers resources. There are many benefits participating existing network URIs, including linking, caching, indexing search engines. stated HTTP URIs enable people URI order access representation resource identified URI.To benefit increase value World Wide Web, data publishers provide URIs as identifiers resources. Provide least machine-readable representation resource identified URI order enable HTTP URIs be data publishers have set up necessary infrastructure elements TCP-based HTTP servers) serve representations resources want make available human-readable HTML representation machine-readable Turtle). publisher supply more representations resource identified URI. However, there clear benefit data users providing least machine-readable representation. More information about serving different representations resource be found URI structure not contain anything change good practice URIs do not contain anything easily change expected change session tokens other state information. URIs be stable reliable order maximize possibilities reuse Linked Data users. There be balance making URIs readable keeping more stable removing descriptive information likely change. more information Architecture World Wide Web: URI Persistence. URI Opacity Architecture World Wide Web best practices treatment URIs time are resolved Web client:Agents making use URIs NOT attempt infer properties referenced resource.URIs be constructed accordance guidance provided document ensure ease use development proper consideration guidelines given herein. However, Web clients accessing such URIs NOT parse otherwise read meaning URIs. URI Policy Persistence Defining documenting persistent URI policy implementation plan vital ongoing success stability publishing open government data. effect changing moving resources effect breaking applications dependent Therefore, government authorities define persistence strategy implementation plan provide content using same Web address, even though resources question have moved. Persistent identifiers are used retain addresses information resources over long term. Persistent identiﬁers are used uniquely identify objects real world concepts, addition information resources. choice particular URI scheme guarantee URIs be persistent. URI persistence matter policy commitment part URI owner. HTTP been designed help manage URI persistence. example, HTTP redirection response codes) permits servers tell agent further action needs be taken agent order fulfill request example, new URI associated resource). PURL concept generalized URL curation HTTP URIs World Wide Web. PURLs allow third party control over URL resolution resource metadata provision. Persistent URL address World Wide Web causes redirection Web resource. Web resource changes location hence URL), PURL pointing be updated. user PURL always uses same Web address, even though resource question have moved. PURLs be used publishers manage own information space Web users manage PURL service independent publisher information. PURL services thus allow management hyperlink integrity. Hyperlink integrity design trade-off World Wide Web, be partially restored allowing resource users third parties influence URL Open Source PURLs Project used widely run persistent identifier management sites. Open Source PURLs Project used libraries, academic organizations, government agencies non-government organizations around world. example, persistent URLs are used United Nations Food Agriculture Organization provide URIs major food crops. National Center Biomedical Ontology persistent URLs unify address terminology used many existing biomedical databases. US Government Printing Office also uses persistent URLs point documents U.S. Budget are deemed essential democratic, transparent government. Recently, software project called Permanent Identifiers Web emerged provide secure, permanent URL re-direction service Web applications. service HTTPS-only mode ensure end-to-end security. means be used Linked Data applications require high levels security such as found financial, medical, public infrastructure sectors. growing group organizations have pledged responsibility ensure operation website over time. interested learning more are encouraged contact W3C Permanent Identifier Community Group. PURLs implement form persistent identiﬁer virtual resources. Other persistent identiﬁer schemes include Digital Object Identiﬁers Life Sciences Identiﬁers INFO URIs. persistent identiﬁcation schemes provide unique identiﬁers changing) virtual resources, not schemes provide curation opportunities. Curation virtual resources been deﬁned as, active involvement information professionals management, including preservation, digital data future use.” persistent identiﬁcation scheme provide curation opportunity virtual resource, allow real-time resolution resource also allow real-time administration identiﬁer. URI Construction following guidance been developed organizations involved URI strategy implementation government agencies: URIs Semantic Web Designing URI Sets UK Public Sector Designing URI Sets UK Public Sector, document UK Cabinet offices design considerations URIs be used publish public sector reference data; Study Persistent URIs identification best practices recommendations topic Member States European Commission NL URI Strategy General-purpose guidelines exist URI designer consider, including URIs Semantic Web, guidance use URIs describe things are not Web documents; Style Guidelines Naming Labeling Ontologies Multilingual Web Internationalized Resource Identifiers Stakeholders are planning create URIs using characters go subset defined are encouraged reference IRIs. Defined IRI protocol element complement Uniform Resource Identifier IRI sequence characters Universal Character Set be therefore used mint identifiers use wider set characters defined Internationalized Domain Name IDN standard approach dealing multilingual domain names was agreed IETF March Internationalized Resource Identifiers use non-ASCII characters URIs relevent organizations interested minting URIs languages including German, Dutch, Spanish, French Chinese. there exist standards focused enabling use international characters Web identifiers, government stakeholders need take account several issues before constructing such internationalized identifiers. section not exhaustive editors point interested audience Introduction Multilingual Web Addresses, however most relevant issues are following: Domain Name lookup: Numerous domain name authorities already offer registration internationalized domain names. include providers top level country domains as etc., global top level domains such as Domain names phishing: problems associated IDN support browsers facilitate phishing are called attacks'. Consequently, most browsers support IDN also put place safeguards protect users such fraud. Encoding problems: IRI standard way creating handling international identifiers, however support IRIs various semantic Web technology stacks libraries not uniform lead difficulties applications working kind identifiers. good reference subject be found URI syntax defined STD Resource Identifier Generic Syntax) URIs small number characters: basically, just upper lower case letters English alphabet, European numerals small number symbols. Standard Vocabularies Standardized vocabularies be reused as much as possible facilitate inclusion expansion Web data. W3C published several useful vocabularies Linked Data. example, following standard vocabularies help developers describe basic more complex relationships describing data catalogs, organizations, multidimensional data, such as statistics Web. Government publishers are encouraged use standardized vocabularies rather reinventing wheel, possible. Specifically, Data Catalog Vocabulary RDF vocabulary designed facilitate interoperability data catalogs published Web. using DCAT describe datasets data catalogs, publishers increase discoverability enable applications easily consume metadata multiple catalogs. further decentralized publishing catalogs federated dataset search sites. Aggregated DCAT metadata serve as manifest file facilitate digital preservation. Organizational structures activities are often described government authorities. Organization Ontology supports publishing organizational information number domains, as Linked Data. Organizational Ontology designed allow domain-specific extensions add classification organizations roles, as as extensions support neighboring information such as organizational activities. Many government agencies publish statistical information public Web. Data Cube Vocabulary means do using Resource Description Framework RDF Data Cube Vocabulary possible discover identify statistical data artifacts uniform way.[CSARVEN] model underpinning Data Cube vocabulary compatible cube model SDMX Data Metadata eXchange), ISO standard exchanging sharing statistical data metadata organizations. Data Cube vocabulary core foundation supports extension vocabularies enable publication other aspects statistical data flows other multi-dimensional datasets. Find Existing Vocabularies There are search tools collect, analyze index vocabularies semantic data available online efficient access. Search tools use structured data represented as Linked Data include: Watson, Sindice, Semantic Web Search Engine, Swoogle, Schemapedia). Others include LOV directory, Prefix.cc, Bioportal domain) European Commission'sJoinup platform. find existing vocabularies data catalogues way around perform search using previously identified key terms datasets catalogs. catalogs provide samples underlying data was modeled used. Vocabulary Checklist section set considerations aimed helping stakeholders review vocabulary evaluate usefulness. Note best practice use extend existing vocabulary before creating new vocabulary. basic vocabulary checklist: ensure vocabularies use are published trusted group organization; ensure vocabularies have permanent URIs; confirm versioning policy. Vocabularies be documented vocabulary be documented. liberal use labels comments, as as appropriate language tags. publisher provide human-readable pages describe vocabulary, along constituent classes properties. Preferably, easily comprehensible use-cases be defined documented. Vocabularies be self-descriptive property term vocabulary have Label, Definition Comment defined. Self-describing data information about encodings used representation provided explicitly representation. ability Linked Data describe place context, usefulness underlying data. example, widely-used Dublin Core vocabulary DCMI Metadata Terms) Term Name Contributor Label: Contributor Definition: entity responsible making contributions resource Comment: Examples Contributor include person, organization, service. Vocabularies be described more language Multilingualism be supported vocabulary, i.e. elements vocabulary have labels, definitions comments available government's official language(s), e.g. Spanish least English.This also important as documentation suppoly appropriate tags language used comments labels. example, same term Contributor rdfs:label rdfs:comment Contributor include person, organization, service"@en de collaborator incluyen persona, organización servicio"@es Vocabularies be used other datasets vocabulary used other authoritative Linked Open datasets helpful. re-use vocabularies achieve benefits Linked Open Data. Selected vocabularies third parties be already use other datasets, as shows are already established LOD community, thus better candidates wider adoption reuse. example: analysis use vocabularies Linked Data cloud FOAF reused more other vocabularies. Vocabularies be accessible long period vocabulary selected provide guarantee maintenance over specified period, ideally indefinitely. Vocabularies be published trusted group organization anyone create vocabulary, always better check person, group authoritative organization responsible publishing maintaining vocabulary. Vocabularies have persistent URLs Persistent access server hosting vocabulary, facilitating reusability necessary. Example: Geo W3C vocabulary most used vocabularies basic representation geometry points been around since always available same namespace. Vocabularies provide versioning policy publisher ideally address compatibility versions over time. Major changes vocabularies be reflected documentation. Vocabulary Creation section set informative considerations aimed stakeholders decide develop own vocabularies. Define URI vocabulary. URI vocabulary be defined. strongly related Best Practices described section URI Construction. example: are minting new vocabulary terms particular government, define URI particular vocabulary. URIs properties non-literal ranges means: Name properties as verb senses, so triples be actually read; e.g. hasProperty Vocabularies be self-descriptive means: property term vocabulary have Label, Definition Comment defined. Self-describing data information about encodings used representation provided explicitly representation. ability Linked Data describe place context, usefulness underlying data. example, widely-used Dublin Core vocabulary DCMI Metadata Terms) Term Name Contributor Label: Contributor Definition: entity responsible making contributions resource Comment: Examples Contributor include person, organization, service. Vocabularies be described more language Multilingualism be supported vocabulary, i.e., elements vocabulary have labels, definitions comments available government's official language, e.g., Spanish, least English. also very important as documentation be clear enough appropriate tag language used comments labels. example, same term Contributor rdfs:label rdfs:comment Contributor include person, organization, service"@en de collaborator incluyen persona, organización servicio"@es Vocabularies provide versioning policy mechanism put place publisher always take care backward compatibilities versions, ways changes affected previous versions. Major changes vocabularies be reflected documentation, machine human-readable formats. Vocabularies provide documentation vocabulary be well-documented machine readable labels comments; tags language used). Also human-readable, extra documentation be provided publisher better understand classes properties, possible valuable use cases. Provide human-readable documentation basic metadata such as creator, publisher, date creation, last modification, version number. Vocabularies be published following available best practices Publish vocabulary Web stable URI using open license.. goals contribute community sharing new vocabulary. end, recommended follow available recipes publishing RDF vocabularies e.g. Best Practice Recipes Publishing RDF Vocabularies Using SKOS Create Controlled Vocabulary SKOS, Simple Knowledge Organization System W3C standard, based other Semantic Web standards OWL), way represent controlled vocabularies, taxonomies thesauri. Specifically, SKOS OWL ontology be written out RDF flavor. W3C SKOS standard portable, flexible controlled vocabulary format increasingly popular, added benefit good entry-level step use Semantic Web technology. SKOS appropriate following situations: There need publish controlled list terms taxonomies having special meaning domain. complexity formality OWL ontology not appropriate example terms are not entities be richly described). creating SKOS vocabulary bear following good practice mind: Make clear distinction collections concepts different individual concepts. Define possible different namespace skos:ConceptScheme Structure concepts list using properties skos:hasTopConcept, skos:broader, skos:narrower. Consider defining Class represent skos:Concepts controlled list facilitate declaration properties use list). Provide multilingual labels terms. Multilingual Vocabularies section not comprehensive however, intended mention issues identified Working Group work performed others relation publishing Linked Data multiple languages. more details multilingualism Web, MultilingualWeb-LT Working Group Multilingual Vocabularies broaden Search writing Note, many available Linked Data vocabularies are English. restrict content being searched multilingual search engines non-English speakers. designing vocabulary, provide labels descriptions possible, several languages, make vocabulary usable global audience. Multilingual vocabularies be found following formats set rdfs:label language been restricted @fr...). Currently, most commonly used approach. skos:prefLabel skosxl:Label), language also been restricted. set monolingual ontologies labels are expressed natural language) same domain mapped aligned other example EuroWordNet, wordnets different natural languages are mapped other so-called ILI inter-lingual-index-, set concepts common categorizations). set ontology lexicon. approach representation linguistic information associated ontologies. idea ontology associated external ontology linguistic descriptions. best exponents case lemon model, ontology linguistic descriptions be related concepts properties ontology provide lexical, terminological, morphosyntactic, etc., information. main advantages approach semantics linguistic information are kept separated. link several lemon models different natural languages same ontology. list codes corresponding URIs representation language names published maintained official registration authority ISO639-2, US Library Congress. Note current trend follow first approach, i.e. use least rdfs:label rdfs:comment term vocabulary. Convert Data Linked Data Now ground work place, next step actually convert dataset Linked Data representation. There more way convert data including scripts, declarative mapping languages, languages perform query translation rather then data translation R2RML). Regardless approach used, data conversion mapping source data set RDF statements. data converted, data serialized RDF statements. RDF be converted range RDF serializations include: RDFa, JSON-LD, Turtle N-Triples, RDF/XML Linked Data modelers developers have certain reasons prefer use RDF serialization over RDF serialization better other. Benefits using over include simplicity, ease reading human) speed processing. Provide Basic Metadata modeling Linked Data metadata, best practice include MIME type, publishing organization agency, creation date, modification date, version, frequency updates, contact email address, information available appropriate data. subsequent sections outline guidance use vocabularies, as as, vocabulary assist modeling process. Link Other Stuff name Linked Open Data means data links other stuff. Data isolation rarely valuable, however, interlinked data suddenly very valuable. There are many popular datasets, such as DBpedia provide valuable data, including photos geographic information. Being able connect data government authority DBpedia example, quick way show value adding content Linked Data Cloud. Provide Machine Access Data major benefit Linked Data access data machines. Machines use variety methods read data including, not limited Direct URI resolution nose"), RESTful API, SPARQL endpoint, file download. SPARQL Protocol RDF Query Language query language RDF data, analogous Structured Query Language relational databases. SPARQL RDF data SQL relational database. more information, SPARQL Overview SPARQL endpoint service SPARQL queries returns answers as SPARQL result sets. best practice datasets providers give URL SPARQL endpoint allow access data programmatically Web interface. list SPARQL endpoints monitoring availability, performance, interoperability discoverability SPARQL Endpoints published Open Knowledge Foundation. Announce Public not scope document discuss domain name issues data hosting however, vital part publication process. Hosting Linked Open Data require involvement agency system security staff require planning often considerable time experise compliance, so involve stakeholders early schedule accordingly. Now ready point people authoritative open government data. Be sure datasets are available authoritative domain. Using authoritative domain increases perception trusted content. Authoritative data regularly updated government domain critical re-use authoritative datasets. following checklist intended help organizations realize benefits publishing open government data, as as, communicate public are serious about providing data over time. Use multiple channels including mailing lists, blogs newsletters announce newly published data set; Publish description published dataset using vocabulary; Define frequency data updates metadata); Associate appropriate license; Plan implement persistence strategy; Ensure data accurate greatest degree possible; Provide form people report problematic data give feedback; Provide contact email address responsible curating publishing data; Ensure staff have necessary training respond timely manner feedback. Social Contract Linked Data Publisher Government publishers Linked Open Data are entering sort contract" users data. Publishers recognize responsibility maintaining data once published. Key access reuse ensuring dataset(s) organization available be maintained over time. Giving due consideration organization's URI strategy be first activities team as prepare Linked Open Data strategy. Authoritative data permanence resolution HTTP URIs. publishers move remove data was published Web, third party applications mashups break. considered rude obvious reasons basis Linked Data contract." good way prevent causing HTTP 404s organization implement persistence strategy. Below provide introduction best practice defining persistence strategy implementation plan. Stability Properties scope document comprehensively treat issues related data stability over time Web. Mention included such readers consider data stability context given agency region. There are characteristics influence stability longevity useful open government data. Many properties are not unique government Linked Open Data, yet influence data cost therefore data value. final note related importance stability. W3C celebrate 20th anniversary Web years old Perhaps surprisingly, first Web page be found. team CERN looking restoring however time writing document, not yet been found.[GBRUMFIEL] Thus, Government Linked Data Working Group wished reference importance data stability as vast majority government data quickly available only digital form. stewards supporters open government data, encumbant pursue methods tools support responsible data stability Web over time.
